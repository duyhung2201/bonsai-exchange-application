This project won 1st prize of Icon Hyperhack - https://bonsai-exchange.web.app.
We plan to extend this project to be an interesting NFT game on ICON platform. Its functionality encompasses:
* Buy Bonsai  (using Oxygen)
* Buy Oxygen (using ICX)
* Each bonsai will release some oxygen periodically (every 30s) 
* Transfering bonsai to friends.

Which we plan to extend:
* Update Bonsai level: the higher level bonsai is, the more oxygen it releases.
